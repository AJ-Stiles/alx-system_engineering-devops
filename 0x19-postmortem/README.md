# Web Stack Outage Post-Mortem

## Introduction

This repository contains a post-mortem analysis of a recent outage in our web stack. The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed account of the incident, including the impact, root cause, timeline, and corrective/preventative measures.

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:**
  - Start Time: November 10, 2023, 15:30 UTC
  - End Time: November 10, 2023, 18:45 UTC

- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected our flagship application, ChatJoy, resulting in a 30% degradation in user experience. Users reported delayed message deliveries, impacting real-time conversations.

- **Root Cause:**
  - A misconfigured caching layer caused excessive database queries, overwhelming our backend infrastructure.

## Timeline

- **Detection:**
  - November 10, 2023, 15:30 UTC
  - Detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in database response times.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated backend services and database connections.
  - Assumed initially that increased user activity was the cause.
  - Explored potential DDoS attacks and network issues.

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Explored the possibility of a new feature causing issues.
  - Considered a recent software deployment as the cause.

- **Escalation:**
  - Escalated to the DevOps and Database Engineering teams for further analysis.

- **Resolution:**
  - Identified the misconfigured caching layer. Adjusted cache settings and optimized database queries.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Cause:**
  - A recent update introduced a configuration change in the caching layer, causing it to bypass critical optimizations. This led to an unexpected surge in database queries.

- **Resolution:**
  - Reconfigured the caching layer settings to ensure proper integration with the database. Implemented a rollback mechanism for configuration changes to prevent similar incidents.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements:**
  - Enhance monitoring alerts to detect abnormal spikes in real-time.
  - Conduct a thorough review of configuration changes before deployment.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement automated checks for caching layer configurations.
  2. Conduct a comprehensive audit of recent deployments.
  3. Enhance documentation for troubleshooting common performance issues.
  4. Schedule regular training sessions for the operations team on new system updates.

## Closing Notes

In the spirit of resilience, we've embraced this incident as an opportunity to strengthen our system's robustness. While our ChatJoy users experienced a temporary hiccup, we're committed to ensuring that our platform not only meets but exceeds their expectations.

## Humor Element
